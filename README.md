# Iowa Liquor Sales in 2020
This is the project work of data visulation.

----

The data set is provided by the Iowa Department of Commerce, Alcoholic Beverages Division. The Iowa Department of Commerce requires that every store that sells
alcohol in bottled form for off-the-premises consumption must hold a class "E" liquor license (an arrangement typical of most of the state alcohol regulatory bodies). All alcoholic sales made by stores registered thusly with the Iowa Department of Commerce are logged in the Commerce department system, which is in turn published
as open data by the State of Iowa. The data points in 2020 were chosen to study some interesting questions about Iowa's liquor sales in this year.
